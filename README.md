CorE2
=====

This project was intented to be a rudimentary game engine based on JFrame.

I started this project with the intention to learn and practice package, class, and function hierarchy.
There was a CorE version with a lot of mistakes from which I learnt a lot, thus refactoring the whole thing and renaming the project to CorE 2.0.


The intended capabilities of the game engine where:


-Create and modify an array of game elements that a renderer class would print on the screen periodically (default 60Hz)

-Modelate the iformation structure of such elements, in a modular basis. The sound module, image module, programming module, etc. These modules were intended to be interchangeables, thus facilitating the creation of new game elements by combining existing modules from different elements.

-Implement a Model View Controller pattern.

-Work with the elements in the renderer array in a very simple way: displace and animate basically.


This was my first work with java and I tried to make the engine as modular as I could. I probably messed it up a lot.
